* [X] double check deduplication
* [X] only keep things >jan 2018
* [X] config+dpltsk as separate category "config"
* [X] config, code, maint as separate categories?
* [X] don't filter SAZ -- mix into single region
* [X] human,netw should be "config"
* [X] >2 hours -- also plot 3, 4 (we want "interesting" stuff)
* [o] check each provider numbers match what's reported in paper
    * deduplication is fine, it's just I kept events before 2018
    * now i'm close to what's reported in the paper:
        * aws: 3 more
        * azure: the same
        * gcp: 6 less
    * I think the difference is due to using an older dataset (the first one). compare with last table [[https://github.com/thezeroalpha/cloud-outage-analysis/blob/master/notebooks/Deduplication%20tests.ipynb|here]]
    * Two options:
        1. roll with this
        2. use the new dataset. the issue is i reindexed the old ones, so don't know how i would combine it with the new dataset. plus i have classifications in separate df, and join the two (classifications+data) on the indices.
* [ ] is it better to normalize in root-causes-severity graph, or not?
* [ ] which of the duration graphs looks most 'interesting'? I think it might be useful to show more than one of those plots to compare differences, but need feedback here
* [ ] re-added components graphs -- which are most useful?
