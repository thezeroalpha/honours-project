* [o] check each provider numbers match what's reported in paper
    * deduplication is fine, it's just I kept events before 2018
    * now i'm close to what's reported in the paper:
        * aws: 3 more
        * azure: the same
        * gcp: 6 less
    * I think the difference is due to using an older dataset (the first one). compare with last table [[https://github.com/thezeroalpha/cloud-outage-analysis/blob/master/notebooks/Deduplication%20tests.ipynb|here]]
    * Two options:
        1. roll with this
        2. use the new dataset. the issue is i reindexed the old ones, so don't know how i would combine it with the new dataset. plus i have classifications in separate df, and join the two (classifications+data) on the indices.
    * choosing option 1.
* [X] is it better to normalize in root-causes-severity graph, or not?
    * no need to normalize. but sort by number of outages. and remove aws.

* [X] outages across week causes - remove aws. make causes [configuration, load, other].
* [X] causes of longer duration: <6, 6-12, >12
* [ ] severity vs users affected: longer abbrevs
* [ ] range vs cause -- load: some users
