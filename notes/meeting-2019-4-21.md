# Meeting notes: Tue Apr 21
* dedupe on four columns: service name, location, start time, end time
* provider-reported severity: 'status' column, look at provider pages to interpret that
* categorise root causes into subcategories.
  look to Gunawi's and Alex's classifications for inspiration.
* Correlation analysis (Pearson)
* explain classification process + abbreviations
* 'causes of outages of varying severity' - remove AWS and explain. or just remove that one facet.
* causes of longer-duration outages: classify outages <2 hours and >2 hours. for shorter duration, "these are problems". for longer, same.
  each facet two bars: short,long durations. each bar with regions corresponding to different failure types.
* flow plot ("alluvial diagram") later maybe?
* severity vs users affected -- too dense, too much information. stacked bar?
* make similar plot as 'outages across week for top 5 components', but for root cause.
* "range+users vs root cause" - stacked bar, reclassify vertical axis. for visual, classify into categories. then table with all categories and numbers
* in report: 5 plots, plus tables.
