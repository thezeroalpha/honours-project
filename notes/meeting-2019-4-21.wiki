= Meeting notes: Tue Apr 21 =
* Graphs/data:
    * [X] dedupe on four columns: service name, location, start time, end time
    * [X] fix missing time zones
    * [X] 'causes of outages of varying severity' - remove AWS and explain. or just remove that one facet.
    * [X] make similar plot as 'outages across week for top 5 components', but for root cause.
    * [X] improve the colors
    * [X] causes of longer-duration outages: classify outages <2 hours and >2 hours. for shorter duration, "these are problems". for longer, same.
            each facet two bars: short,long durations. each bar with regions corresponding to different failure types.
    * [X] severity vs users affected -- too dense, too much information. stacked bar?
    * [o] "range+users vs root cause" - stacked bar, reclassify vertical axis. for visual, classify into categories. then table with all categories and numbers
    * [ ] categorise root causes into subcategories.
          look to Gunawi's and Alex's classifications for inspiration.
    * [ ] Correlation analysis (Pearson)
    * [ ] flow plot ("alluvial diagram") later maybe?
    * [ ] provider-reported severity: 'status' column, look at provider pages to interpret that
* Paper
    * [ ] explain classification process + abbreviations
    * [ ] in report: 5 plots, plus tables.
