= Meeting notes: Tue Apr 21 =
* Graphs/data:
    * [X] dedupe on four columns: service name, location, start time, end time
    * [X] fix missing time zones
    * [X] 'causes of outages of varying severity' - remove AWS and explain. or just remove that one facet.
    * [X] make similar plot as 'outages across week for top 5 components', but for root cause.
    * [X] improve the colors
    * [X] causes of longer-duration outages: classify outages <2 hours and >2 hours. for shorter duration, "these are problems". for longer, same.
            each facet two bars: short,long durations. each bar with regions corresponding to different failure types.
    * [X] severity vs users affected -- too dense, too much information. stacked bar?
    * [X] "range+users vs root cause" - stacked bar, reclassify vertical axis. for visual, classify into categories.
    * [X] categorise root causes into subcategories.
          look to Gunawi's and Alex's classifications for inspiration.
    * [X] Correlation analysis (Pearson)
        * Pearson only for continuous variables though?
        * tried to do Cramer's V (correlation for nominal categorical variables, based on Pearson)
            * results: affected/range, affected/users, cause/users
        * follow up with Thiel's U (uncertainty coefficient) for asymmetric: "provides a value in the range of [0,1], 0 means feature y provides no information about feature x, and 1 means that feature y provides full information about feature x's value"
            * results are inconclusive, though: range given affected, cause given affected, severity given affected, users given affectd, affected given cause
    * [ ] flow plot ("alluvial diagram") later maybe?
    * [ ] provider-reported severity: 'status' column, look at provider pages to interpret that
* Paper
    * [ ] explain classification process + abbreviations
    * [ ] in report: 5 plots, plus tables.
    * [ ] for causes, make table with all detailed categories and numbers
