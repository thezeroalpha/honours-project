\section{Methodology}
% include whatever is in the nsdi paper
% data source - provider-reported data

% original column - vendor
% deduplicate based on service name, location, start time, end time. removes 330 events: 133 azure, 127 aws, 70 gcp
% calculate duration in mins based on end time minus start time
% based on start time, calculate year, and hour of week
% only keep events in 2018 and later (why?)
%
% manually classify based on textual description:
% - services: multiple, one
% - severity: degraded performance, unavailable, visual
% - range: multiple regions, single availability zone, single region
%   - single availability zone is only AWS, so combine this with single region for analysis purposes (around 13 events)
% - users: some, all
% - cause: configuration error, internal api issue, third party, not provided, shock event, environmental conditions, code error, deployment task, internal network issue, unhealthy unit, maintenance side effect, increased load
%   - aggregate into broader categories for analysis: code error, maintenance side effect, configuration error + deployment task, network (internal api issue, internal network issue), external (environmental conditions, shock event, third party), increased load, unknown, unhealthy unit
% - duration: continuous, not provided, intermittent
% - affected: user interface, external requests (apis), external network/connectivity, not provided, storage, internal network, certificates/licenses, nodes/devices/instances, internal communication interfaces, processing backend
%
% final number - 481 events (205 GCP, 144 AWS, 132 Azure)
