  abstract = {We conducted a cloud outage study ({COS}) of 32 popular Internet services. We analyzed 1247 headline news and public post-mortem reports that detail 597 unplanned outages that occurred within a 7-year span from 2009 to 2015. We analyzed outage duration, root causes, impacts, and ﬁx procedures. This study reveals the broader availability landscape of modern cloud services and provides answers to why outages still take place even with pervasive redundancies.},

  abstract = {We conduct a comprehensive study of development and deployment issues of six popular and important cloud systems (Hadoop {MapReduce}, {HDFS}, {HBase}, Cassandra, {ZooKeeper} and Flume). From the bug repositories, we review in total 21,399 submitted issues within a three-year period (20112014). Among these issues, we perform a deep analysis of 3655 “vital” issues (i.e., real issues affecting deployments) with a set of detailed classiﬁcations. We name the product of our one-year study Cloud Bug Study database ({CBSDB}) [9], with which we derive numerous interesting insights unique to cloud systems. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the largest bug study for cloud systems to date.},
